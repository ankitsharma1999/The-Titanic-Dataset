# Machine Learning model for The Titanic Dataset
This repo contains the data of the people who were travelling on the ill fated Titanic in three CSV files.
One of the CSV file contains the training data to train the classifier and the other one contains testing data
to test the classifier.
The third one contains the correct answer to check against the classifiers's prediction.
This model makes use of the pandas and the numpy module for data pre-processing and the Scikitlearn's
support vector classifier to train the classifier.
These modules can be downloaded by the pi install commands.
